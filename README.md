**Potato Leaf Disease Detection Project**

This project focuses on the detection of potato leaf diseases, specifically targeting three classes: Potato Early Blight, Potato Healthy, and Potato Late Blight. The dataset comprises a total of 2152 images, distributed as follows: 1000 images of Potato Early Blight, 152 images of Potato Healthy, and 1000 images of Potato Late Blight. Leveraging these images, we have developed a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify the health status of potato leaves.
To facilitate user interaction, we have created a web application using Flask, providing a graphical user interface (GUI). This web app allows users to upload images of potato leaves and receive real-time predictions about the presence of diseases. The intuitive design ensures ease of use, making it accessible even to those without a technical background.
